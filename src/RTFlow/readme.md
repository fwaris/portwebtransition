# RTFlow

A library for realtime multi-agent systems.

See [write-up](https://github.com/fwaris/RTOpenAI/blob/master/src/Samples/PlanSelection/RT.Assistant/docs/writeup.md)

To understand how to use this library, see the [RT.Assistant](https://github.com/fwaris/RTOpenAI/tree/master/src/Samples/PlanSelection/RT.Assistant#readme) sample code.

> Note this library is a work in progress. Different version of the source exist in different repos for now. Once the code is settled, it will be packaged as an independent library.
