The default 'plan' is to find a cell phone case on Amazon.

Alternate [plans](/Agentic/Plans.fs) exist for finding 'neurosymbolic ai' related content on Twitter (X) and Reddit. They can be set to run via a minor code change.

Click the triangle icon to start the plan.

When the plan is started, the first 'task' waits for the user to login to the site. Its a manual step. Then click the continue icon  `>>|`  to let CUA drive the next steps. You may click `>>|` without logging in, if desired.


Depending on the plan selected, the plans collect some data from the various sites and call a tool to store that data. 

Drop the burger menu and click the report (or people) icon to view the collected data.
